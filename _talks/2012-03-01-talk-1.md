In this presentation, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 Monkeypox Outbreak. Utilizing advanced mathematical modeling techniques alongside time series clustering, we aim to shed light on the patterns, progression, and potential future scenarios of the outbreak. This approach not only provides a quantitative understanding of the disease's spread but also offers insights that can guide public health responses.
