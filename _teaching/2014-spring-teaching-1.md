Roles
======
At the University of Cape Coast, I had the esteemed role of instructing courses in Advanced Calculus I and II, where I was deeply involved in guiding students through intricate mathematical theories and applications. My responsibilities spanned from designing comprehensive lesson plans to conducting hands-on tutorials, ensuring that every student could navigate the complexities of calculus with confidence. I took pride in offering additional review sessions and one-on-one tutoring, catering to individual student needs and ensuring their academic success. My dedication to teaching was reflected in my constant endeavors to create an interactive and engaging learning atmosphere, adjusting my methodologies to suit diverse learning needs and consistently seeking feedback to enhance my teaching approach.
