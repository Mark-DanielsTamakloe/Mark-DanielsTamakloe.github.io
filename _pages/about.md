Hi there! I'm Mark-Daniels Tamakloe, currently a second-year PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, working in the CausalAI Lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and causal inference. Specifically, I focus on using causal mediation analysis to explore how race impacts treatment outcomes. I am passionate about harnessing cutting-edge AI and ML techniques to address these critical healthcare disparities.

Outside of my research, I enjoy playing soccer (both in real life and FC24) on my PS5. I'm always up for a good game and love the balance it brings to my academic pursuits. I'm excited about the future, where the fusion of technology and causal inference will help reshape healthcare to be more equitable and effective.
